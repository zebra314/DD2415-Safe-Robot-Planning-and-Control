Feedback Motion Primitives (FBMPs)

- Feedback Motion Primitives are state-feedback-controlled trajectories generated from a set of possible initial states $X_0$ and control inputs $U$.
- They are designed to contract the state uncertainty over time, resulting in a "shrinking" reachable set.
- The reachable set at the end of the motion primitive is always a subset of the initial state set due to feedback control.
